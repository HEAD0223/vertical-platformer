This web application is designed for a multi-room platformer game using HTML5/Canvas. I created and implemented features such as collisions, movement, gravity, a following camera, a tiled map system. Players navigate using arrow keys, with the top arrow serving as a jump, ensuring an immersive and seamless gaming experience.
